    <h3>Development Notes</h3>
    <h4>12-31-20</h4>
        <p>I haven't worked on this site in ages, but I had the idea that it would be nice to upload some of my videos from YouTube onto this site with the things I set up in case of COPPA, which hasn't been as problematic as expected. These videos have since used the HTML5 player instead of manually embedding the Camtasia Smart Player. You can see these videos <a href="videos/allvideos.html">here.</a></p>
    <h4>11-24-19</h4>
        <p>After spending yesterday and today rendering with Camtasia's Smart Player and embedding it manually into my website, I have concluded everything works. You can look at the playback test <a href="videos/videos/playbacktest/playbacktest.html">here.</a></p>
    <h4>11-23-19</h4>
        <p>Due to YouTube's frisky new compliance with COPPA and the FTC, incase necessary, I'm going to experiment playback of video on my own site, incase I need to move video making to this site. If YouTube's changes DO happen and using my site for video making isn't sufficient, I'll consider moving to a platform like Vimeo.</p>
    <h4>8-30-19</h4>
        <p>Rebrand back to Right Angle Productions.</p>
    <h4>5-18-19</h4>
        <p>society has been cancelled.</p>
    <h4>2-7-19</h4>
        <p>GitHub Desktop has been a poo lately, so this announcement edit is just a test to see if it will actually work. If you are seeing this message, that means its working</p>
    <h4>1-31-19</h4>
        <p>Now working with milesns.ml and milesns.github.io</p>
    <h4>1-16-19</h4>

    <h4>12-16-18</h4>
