<h2>I am MilesNS</h2> 

<p>I do lots of things, mostly cringy stuff that is cringy. Lets talk about it!</p>    

<h3>Starting with YouTube!</h3>    

<p>I make YouTube videoes that don't have a definite subject. If i were to try to catagorise it, I would say Gaming, Technology, YTP, and Cringy randomness. If you want to watch a video, go see the YouTube page.</p>

<p>If you really want, you can see the Channel Trailer, but it is from the Miles's NerdySwag! era, and it is way too irrelevant, so its best you save your sanity.</p>

<h3>Graphic Design</h3>    

<p>I am into Photoshop as a hobby, sort of, as almost all clipart on this website is graphic design made by me. No, i dont really make things for people professionaly, just for myself and friends.</p>

<h4>See some examples</h4>
